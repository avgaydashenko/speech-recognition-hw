Speech recognition homework

Notes:
* Data for only single speaker is used (p239) from VCTK-Corpus as it has the most number of entries
* Label Error Rate should be considered as Character Error Rate since we don't have phomene marking in the dataset
* LER is calculated just the same as in the paper
